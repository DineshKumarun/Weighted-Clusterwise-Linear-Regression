## 📌 Project Overview
Weighted Clusterwise Linear Regression (WCLR) is a hybrid approach that combines **clustering and regression** by introducing adaptive weight matrices and quadratic distance measures. This method enhances accuracy and interpretability in **heterogeneous datasets** by effectively partitioning data into meaningful clusters and assigning **specific regression models** to each.

### 🔥 Key Features
- **Clusterwise Regression (CR):** Partition large datasets into homogeneous clusters, each modeled by a separate linear regression.
- **Adaptive Quadratic Distance:** Uses positive definite matrices to improve clustering accuracy.
- **Weight Optimization:** Incorporates different constraint-based weighting schemes to enhance performance.
- **Application Areas:** 
  - Housing Price Prediction 🏡
  - Customer Segmentation 📊
  - Financial Forecasting 💰
  - Anomaly Detection 🚨
